Implementation Notes
This implementation:

Creates a landing page where users can check their GPU compatibility and download the bootstrap script
Provides a comprehensive PowerShell script that handles:

GPU compatibility checking
CUDA installation (if needed)
Ollama installation
Model downloads
ngrok tunnel setup
FastAPI server setup
Registration with rentahal.com
System tray application for easy status monitoring


Adds a server-side endpoint to webgui.py that:

Accepts node registrations from the bootstrap script
Validates and adds new workers to the worker pool
Updates existing nodes if they reconnect
Sends a notification to sysops when new nodes join



The approach is designed to be as simple as possible for end users - they visit a URL, click a button, run the script as admin, and everything else happens automatically.
The script is robust with error handling, progress indicators, and validation at each step.
This solution bolts on to your existing codebase without modifying core functionality, making it easy to integrate with your current system.
Let me know if you'd like any clarification or modifications to the implementation!
